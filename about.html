                   Across millennia, lives have been destroyed because of wrath, anger, and insatiable lust for
Possessiveness. Healthy bodies have fallen prey to diseases, because all they did when alive, was to
Complain and grumble.
                   Where did smile get overshadowed by solemnity and frown? Somewhere along the withering away
 of childhood, when responsibilities and challenges got them. Or maybe, it was simply the society,
thus rendering "smile" with a million dollar tag
 
                  In today's time, a smile is indeed worth millions of dollars. A cheerful smile helps to cut the cost
of expensive hospital bills. It makes us positive against challenges and aggression. A calm mind
                  Allows us to think before taking any course of action. This sanity leads us to passionate efforts and
desired outcomes afterward. A smile also provides us with some relaxation in the strenuous
Routine of our day-to-day lives.
So smile...
 
Because the world needs it!
You need it!
And...
It is need of the hour.
