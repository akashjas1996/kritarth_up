									<p>KRITARTH being a perfect platform for showcasing talents by raising social awareness on various issues that has proved to be a great success since its first edition which started in 2015. KRITARTH is basically spreading social awareness on a large scale through plethora of events which is some-way or the other associated to a social cause. The idea behind KRITARTH is to make people aware about their service towards the society that a human being can inculcate and it is all about completely following the footsteps of our Founder Prof. Achyuta Samantha Sir who is a perfect epitome in the field of social service, the living legend.</p>

									<p class="leading">“The biggest victory for Today’s mankind is being independent from their own dependencies.”</p>

									<h1>MILLION DOLLAR SMILE</h1>



									<p>Across millennia, lives have been destroyed because of wrath, anger, and insatiable lust for Possessiveness. Healthy bodies have fallen prey to diseases, because all they did when alive, was to Complain and grumble.
									Where did smile get overshadowed by solemnity and frown? Somewhere along the withering away
 									of childhood, when responsibilities and challenges got them. Or maybe, it was simply the society,
									thus rendering "smile" with a million dollar tag
 
									In today's time, a smile is indeed worth millions of dollars. A cheerful smile helps to cut the cost
									of expensive hospital bills. It makes us positive against challenges and aggression. A calm mind
									Allows us to think before taking any course of action. This sanity leads us to passionate efforts and
									desired outcomes afterward. A smile also provides us with some relaxation in the strenuous
									Routine of our day-to-day lives.
									So smile...
									 
									Because the world needs it!
									You need it!
									And...
									It is need of the hour.</p>
									<p class="leading">Vision of KRITARTH 5.0</p>
